<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going. 

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print." 

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management. 

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->
    
<title>Mikey Morrissey</title>
    
    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.--> 
    
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    
     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.--> 
    
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
  
  
<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->
    
<body>
       
<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.  

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->
    
     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>
     <h2>I discovered the field of Computer Science through an introductory C++ programming course, and I quickly became enamoured with writing my own programs. After completing the course, however, I still hadn't considered it as a viable career option as I was more interested in Architecture, Environmental Engineering, and Economics. Eventually, my teacher convinced me to take AP Computer Science the following year. The object-oriented design of the Java programming language opened my eyes to the possibility of pursuing a Computer Science major in college. I spent the following summer learning various programming languages through Code Academy and began submitting college applications with my intended major as Computer Science!</h2>

Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>I would define family as those who provide you with support and unconditional love; I consider my family to be a vital piece in my life. My parents always encouraged me to pursue my passions and pushed me to reach my fullest potential. They were there for every soccer game and track meet, supported me when I was transferring to the University of Pittsburgh, and have gone on countless adventures with me. I deeply admire and strive to be like my older sister. She is my best friend, an even greater sibling, and someone I know I can always count on. I don't think 'family' necessarily means blood related as I also consider my close friends to be family. To me, home is somewhere you feel welcome and comfortable. Over the last few years, I've called many places my home. I grew up in Pittsburgh and have lived in the Sewickley area most of my life. However, in 2017 I moved to Seattle, Washington to attend the University of Washington. While it was initially a significant change and culture shock, I grew to love the city and I greatly enjoyed the two years I lived there. However, being away from my family became too difficult and I decided to transfer to Pitt to be closer to home. I wouldn't consider Pitt and the Oakland area to be my perfect match, but I have grown to appreciate it's beauty and idiosyncrasies.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

  <h2>Currently, I use media to stay informed on current events and expand my knowledge. I read various news sites such as The New York Times and listen to podcasts like NPR. I also utilize social media such as Instagram, Tik Tok, and VSCO to stay connected with my friends, share my own media, and entertain myself. When it comes to "remaking" media, I listen to music on Spotify, watch live performances on YouTube, and memorize tabs to learn how to play songs on guitar and sing the melody. The song "Imagine" by John Lennon, in the above YouTube video, is one of my favorite songs to play on guitar. In my future career in the field of computer sciecne, I imagine that I will continue to engage with media and even create my own.</h2>

<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)--> 

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Community</h1>
    </div>
   
    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>In my life, I would consider myself to be apart of many different communities:
      
        Soccer has always been a passion of mine and has kept me grounded; I started playing when I was only three years old at my local YMCA. I have so many fond memories such as making the 7th grade soccer team, going to countless cup tournaments, and winning the WPIAL Championship during my senior year of high school. I even enjoyed the games in the pouring rain, the grueling two mile run at high school tryouts, and my dad making me play with only my left foot for an entire season. Soccer has provided me such stability over the years and I am so thankful that it was and will continue to be a part of my life.
        
        Another community I belong to is music. I have been an avid guitar player over the last four years and I have begun to write my own music. Over quaranite, I expanded my skillset by learning how to play the piano, base guitar, and drums. Music is something that I can get lost in and I regret not learning to play guitar sooner. However, I am greatful to now have a creative outlet to express myselff.
        
        A final community that I belong to is hiking. When I was only six years old, my family and I went on our firsrt hiking trip to The Great Smokey Mountains National Park. Ever since, we have gone hiking almost every summer. Some of the national parks I have visited include Glacier, Zion, Olympic, Shenandoah, The Great Smokey Mountains, Rocky Mountain, and various other state parks. Hiking is a great way to escape into nature and is one of my favorite warm weather activities.  </h2>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->
    
    <div class="par-centertext">   
  <h2>I think higher education at the university level is a stepping stone that propels you into your future endeavors. I have gained much hands-on experience by taking various high-level programming courses at both the University of Washington and the University of Pittsburgh. Being sucessful in past courses has given me the opportunity to be a TA, work on research, and complete interesting projects. I am currently preparing to apply to graduate school to achieve either a Neuroscience or Computer Science masters degree in order work in a cutting edge field: artificial intelligence. </h2>
